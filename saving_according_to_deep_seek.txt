Absolutely! Splitting your save system into distinct functions for different
data types is not only sensible but recommended for a maintainable architecture.
Here's why this approach shines and how to structure it effectively:
Key Benefits of Separate Save Functions

	Separation of Concerns
	Each system handles its own data, preventing bloated save files and
	accidental overrides.

	Granular Control
	Save only what needs updating (e.g., save favorites immediately on change
	vs. game_progress at checkpoints).

	Error Isolation
	A corruption in favorites data wonâ€™t break your entire save system.

	Performance Optimization
	Frequent saves (like favorites) can target small files, while infrequent
	ones (config) write larger datasets.

Recommended Structure
Save Type			Data Example			Frequency		File Name
save_config()		Volume					On change		user://config.cfg
save_game()			Collectibles			Checkpoints		user://save1.dat
save_favorites()	Starred/custom levels	On toggle		user://favorites.json

Implementation Strategy

	Use Dedicated Files
	Avoid a monolithic save file. Separate files let you safely modify one dataset without risking others.
	gdscript
	Copy

	# Save favorites (pseudo-code)
	func save_favorites():
		var fav_data = {"favorites": favorite_levels}
		save_to_file("user://favorites.json", fav_data)

	Leverage Godotâ€™s ConfigFile
	For settings, use Godotâ€™s built-in ConfigFile class, which handles key-value pairs with sections:
	gdscript
	Copy

	# Save resolution and volume
	func save_config():
		var config = ConfigFile.new()
		config.set_value("graphics", "resolution", current_resolution)
		config.set_value("audio", "volume", master_volume)
		config.save("user://settings.cfg")

	Dynamic vs. Static Workflows

		Favorites (Dynamic): Save immediately on user action.

		Game Progress (Semi-Static): Save at intentional moments (menu confirmations, level exits).

		Config (Static): Save only when explicitly changed.

When to Combine Data

Consider a unified save only if:

	Your datasets are tightly coupled (e.g., favorites depend on unlocked levels).

	You need atomicity (all data must save together to prevent partial updates).
	(Not common in menu-based games.)

Advanced Tip: Use a Save Manager

Create an autoload SaveManager to centralize file operations while keeping data handlers decoupled:
gdscript
Copy

# SaveManager.gd (autoload)
func save_json(path: String, data: Dictionary):
	# Handles file errors, JSON stringifying, etc.

func load_json(path: String) -> Dictionary:
	# Handles missing files, parsing errors

Then delegate to feature-specific modules:
gdscript
Copy

# ConfigManager.gd
func save_config():
	var data = {"resolution": resolution, "volume": volume}
	SaveManager.save_json("user://config.json", data)

Final Verdict

Your intuition is spot-on â€“ splitting saves by data type is excellent for:

	Maintainability (easy to debug/configmgr/favoritesmgr.png)

	User Experience (quick saves for favorites, fewer writes for static data)

	Future-Proofing (add/remove systems without refactoring everything)

Just ensure consistent naming conventions and centralize low-level file operations to avoid code duplication. ðŸ˜Š
